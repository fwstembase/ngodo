# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Key improvements: 1) Changed from expanding layout to floating popup using absolute positioning (bottom-full, mb-2), 2) Added smooth animations with Framer Motion (AnimatePresence, opacity, scale, y-axis transitions with 0.2s duration), 3) Enhanced button design with proper icons (circle indicator for status, Edit icon, Trash2 icon), 4) Improved visual hierarchy with shadow-2xl, border-gray-200, and proper spacing, 5) Added hover effects (bg-gray-50 for normal buttons, bg-red-600 for delete), 6) Menu now appears above button without causing layout shift or box expansion. Applied to 3 locations: Grid view in Sewakan Barang page, Mobile detail view, and Desktop detail view. Fully responsive and works across all device sizes. See /app/KELOLA_BARANG_ENHANCEMENT.md for detailed documentation."

        comment: "TESTING BLOCKED: Unable to access the main application interface to test the Kelola Barang menu functionality. Issue: The application appears to have authentication guards or routing logic that redirects all routes (/sewakan-barang, etc.) back to the landing page. Even with cached items (6 items found in console logs), the UI remains on the homepage without showing the main app interface. The 'Kelola Barang' buttons are not accessible for testing because: 1) No 'Masuk' button visible on homepage, 2) Direct navigation to /sewakan-barang redirects to landing page, 3) No clear path to access authenticated sections of the app. Code review shows the implementation exists in page.js with proper floating menu design, but testing requires access to authenticated user interface. Recommendation: Main agent should verify authentication flow and ensure proper navigation to sewakan-barang page works."

        comment: "COMPLETED: CTA section ('Siap Mulai dengan PinjamAja?' with 'Daftar Sekarang - Gratis!' button) now only displays when user is not logged in. Implementation: Wrapped CTA section with conditional rendering {!user && (...)}. When user is logged in (user state is not null), the entire CTA section is hidden from the DOM. When user is logged out (user state is null), the CTA section displays normally. This provides a cleaner experience for logged-in users who don't need to see the registration call-to-action. Verified with browser console logs showing CTA exists when logged out."

        comment: "FIXED: Wishlist items were not being saved to database when user clicked 'Tambah ke Wishlist' button. Root cause: handleAddToWishlist function was only saving to localStorage instead of calling Supabase API. Solution: Modified handleAddToWishlist to be async and call addToWishlist(user.id, itemId) API function, which saves to Supabase database. The function now: 1) Checks if user is logged in, 2) Checks if item already in wishlist, 3) Calls addToWishlist API to save to database, 4) Updates local state with result from API including proper wishlist item structure, 5) Shows success/error toast messages. Wishlist items will now persist across sessions and sync via Realtime subscriptions."
